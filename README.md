# MSCProject

This is the code for my [MATH 313 Introduction to Number Theory](https://catalog.williams.edu/MATH/detail/?strm=1213&cn=313&crsid=011665) course finals presentation.

The presentation is delivered by Michael Bedard, Alexander Paolozzi, Daniel Queen, and Ye Shu (ordered by last name). It focuses on the [Wiener's attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener's_attack) (also known as the low private exponent attack) on RSA. In the presentation, we mathematically proved how and why the attack works.

Stars and contributions are welcomed!

## Running

This repository contains codes implementing [Wiener's attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener's_attack) in Python 3.

All dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt). To run this program, you need to clone this repo, install the dependencies with `pip`, and run the main file `Wiener.py`

```bash
# Clone & Enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/oluwatimilehin12/MScProject.git
cd RSA_Attack
(if the above did not work, try the below one )

or 
# Clone & Enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/oluwatimilehin12/MScProject.git
cd MSC_Project


# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run it!
python3 Wiener.py
```

## Licensing

All codes under the root directory are written by [Ye Shu (@yechs)](https://github.com/yechs) and are open sourced under [the MIT license](./LICENSE). Anyone can use and redistribute the codes freely as long as they preserve the copyright notices.

#### Exception

However, do note that this repo also contains codes from [pablocelayes/rsa-wiener-attack](https://github.com/pablocelayes/rsa-wiener-attack/tree/906d06109b600ebb515490bc061a2a4072052c14), which are not properly licensed with a free software license. 

These codes are used to generate RSA keypairs vulnerable to Wiener's Attack (i.e. with small private exponent), when you do not supply the program with existing ones.

All unlicensed codes are under the [`libs`](/libs) directory, use them at your own risk.
